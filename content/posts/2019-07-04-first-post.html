<p>It seems worthwhile to create a website. There have been a few before this including blogger and wordpress. There’s still a travel one, mostly filled with draft posts. I should get around to updating that sometime. In the mean time, here’s another start.</p>
<p>I’ve got some ideas about what I want to write about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much space is dedicated to cars in Auckland, specifically around <a href="https://app.traveltimeplatform.com/search/0_lng=174.84922&amp;0_tt=15&amp;0_mode=walking&amp;0_title=Panmure%2C%20New%20Zealand&amp;0_lat=-36.89815">transit stations</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The weirdness of setting up a blog.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating dashboards for New Zealand <a href="https://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/">electricity</a> data.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing links that I’ve currently got saved in my bookmarks that other people might find useful too and then I can clean up my bookmarks.</p></li>
<li><p>Development of new toy packages and eventually some useful ones too.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it for now bye see you later.</p>
