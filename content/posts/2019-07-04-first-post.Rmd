It seems worthwhile to create a website. There have been a few before this including blogger and wordpress. There's still a travel one, mostly filled with draft posts. I should get around to updating that sometime. In the mean time, here's another start. 

I've got some ideas about what I want to write about: 

* How much space is dedicated to cars in Auckland, specifically around [transit stations](https://app.traveltimeplatform.com/search/0_lng=174.84922&0_tt=15&0_mode=walking&0_title=Panmure%2C%20New%20Zealand&0_lat=-36.89815). 

* The weirdness of setting up a blog. 

* Creating dashboards for New Zealand [electricity](https://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/) data. 

* Sharing links that I've currently got saved in my bookmarks that other people might find useful too and then I can clean up my bookmarks. 

* Development of new toy packages and eventually some useful ones too. 

That's it for now bye see you later.
