      <description>It seems worthwhile to create a website. There have been a few before this including blogger and wordpress. There’s still a travel one, mostly filled with draft posts. I should get around to updating that sometime. In the mean time, here’s another start.

How much space is dedicated to cars in Auckland, specifically around transit stations.
The weirdness of setting up a blog.</description>
